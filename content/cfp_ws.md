## SEMANTiCS Workshops and Tutorials
SEMANTiCS 2026 is a major venue for research and industrial innovation and features a workshop and tutorial program addressing the diverse practical interests of its audience. This program is intended to offer a rich diversity of topics to conference attendees and local participants seeking to pick up new skills and stay up-to-date regarding the latest developments in the community. We encourage submissions of proposals on all topics in the general areas of SEMANTiCS 2026 and proposals bridging or introducing new perspectives and/or challenges in these areas. Workshops and tutorials may incorporate panel discussions, lightning talks, meetings, networking or hands-on sessions, hackathons and other practical formats where applicable. Rooms for business or project meetings are available upon request as well.
## Scope & Goals
Workshops and tutorials at SEMANTiCS 2026 allow your organization or project to advance and promote your topics and gain increased visibility. The workshops and tutorials will be announced on the SEMANTiCS website, and they will be seen by all participants. SEMANTiCS 2026 workshops and tutorials can be incubators for industrial and scientific communities that form and share a particular research and development agenda, and they will provide a forum for presenting contributions and findings to a diverse and knowledgeable community. Furthermore, the event can be used as a dissemination activity in the scope of large research projects or as a closed format for research/commercial project consortia meetings.
## Proceedings
Workshop papers will be published in the SEMANTiCS side event proceedings through CEUR. Side events proceedings will include posters & demos and contributions from workshops. 

## Setup and Requirements 
SEMANTiCS 2026 workshops and tutorials may be either half or full-day long. Workshops and tutorials take place on the days before and/or after the main SEMANTiCS 2026 EU conference (03th of September 2026). Further details will be communicated in due time.

Organizers of workshops and tutorials will be granted three free tickets (only for the workshop & tutorial day) for organization purposes or keynotes. Participants of workshops and tutorials will only be charged a reduced fee to cover the basic costs. 
Workshop and tutorial proposals must include the following information:
- outline of the **themes and goals of the event**, including a title and a brief abstract (less than 200 words) intended for the SEMANTiCS 2026 website.
- a statement addressing why the event is important, **why the event is timely**, and how it is relevant to SEMANTiCS 2026 and the field of Semantic Web. For the tutorials, why the presenters are qualified for a high-quality introduction to the topic.
- **related workshops and conferences**, i.e., specifying if this is a continuation of a workshop series or a new workshop. Please provide information about past versions (in any) and other related workshops (including URLs and submission/acceptance counts, if available).
- a statement addressing the **quality assurance criteria** that will be used by the event organizers to select the papers for the workshops and the presenters for the tutorials (e.g., peer review or review/evaluation by event organizers). If a peer review process is chosen as a quality assurance criterion for the workshops, the organizers will be responsible for their own reviewing process. Workshop organizers will be responsible also for their own publicity (e.g., website, timelines and call for papers) and proceedings production. 
- **structure of the event** and plans for generating and stimulating discussion; how will the interaction be organized in case of a hybrid event.
- expected **number of event participants** and (in case of previously held events) number of registered attendees and website for previous editions of the event
- a **description** of the intended audience and the expected learning **outcomes**.
- desired **prerequisite** knowledge of the audience.
- proposed **duration of the event** (i.e., half or full day), different sessions if applicable (final time slot will be assigned in accordance with the SEMANTiCS program).
- any **equipment**, room capacity, or other logistic constraints.
- full **contact information** of all organizers of the event and main contact person; a brief description of each **organizer's background**, including relevant past experience in organizing events.

Proposals for workshop and tutorial proposals must be submitted via Easychair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semantics2026  (max 4 pages)

## About SEMANTiCS Conference
Since 2005, the annual SEMANTiCS conference has been the meeting place for researchers, industry experts, and business leaders to discuss the latest trends and application scenarios in the fields of Knowledge Graphs, Machine Learning, Data Science, Linked Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing.
SEMANTiCS tackles challenges faced by information managers, software engineers, IT architects and various domain experts who are involved in the development, implementation and evaluation of semantic software systems. The SEMANTiCS program offers a diverse range of technical talks, panel discussions on relevant topics, and contributions from individuals actively engaged in practical implementation or scholarly research. Attendees can network with experts in a variety of fields. These relationships provide great value to organizations as they encounter subtle technical issues at any stage of implementation. The expertise gained by SEMANTiCS attendees has a long-term impact on their professional trajectories and organizational endeavors. These factors make SEMANTiCS the major outreach event on semantic technologies across Europe, America and beyond.
