# Travel Grant

Dear Participants, 

We would like to draw your attention to the GOBLIN COST Action (CA23147) – “Global Network on Large-Scale, Cross-domain and Multilingual Open Knowledge Graphs” [(http://cost.eu/actions/CA23147)](http://cost.eu/actions/CA23147) – which offers conference grants to researchers working on Knowledge Graph technologies who have an accepted paper in the main track of a relevant high-level conference, such as SEMANTiCS.

The GOBLIN Action provides two types of conference grants:

- (1) **Young Researcher and Innovator (YRI) Conference Grants** fund a presentation (poster/oral presentation) of own work by a Young Researcher and Innovator in a high-level conference fully organized by a third party, i.e. not organized nor co-organized by the GOBLIN COST Action. The call is open to GOBLIN Action participants aged below 40 years.
Please check the [call for YRI conference grants](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uLggVCgPTXmv4M_TUocqaBP9dKmv_6GW/view) for more details and the grant application process.

- (2) **Inclusiveness Target Countries (ITC) Conference Grants** fund oral presentations of own work falling within the scope of the GOBLIN Action by an Action Participant affiliated to a legal entity located in an Inclusiveness Target Country / Near Neighbour Country in a high-level conference fully organized by a third party, i.e. not organized nor co-organized by the GOBLIN COST Action.
The call is open to action participants affiliated in ITCs [(Inclusiveness Target Countries)](https://www.cost.eu/about/strategy/excellence-and-inclusiveness/) and NNCs [(Near Neighbour Countries)](https://www.cost.eu/cost-meets-researchers-nnc/) countries.
Please check the call for [ITC conference grants](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Vzbn7FBVN7kVoKnRGVi_Ua7FxqHYn8m/view) for more details and the grant application process.

The grant can be used to offset costs such as travel, accommodation, subsistence, and registration fees.
We look forward to welcoming GOBLIN-funded participants to Vienna for SEMANTiCS 2025, taking place from 3–5 September – **see you there!**
