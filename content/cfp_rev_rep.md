## Research and Innovation Track

The SEMANTiCS 2025 conference is excited to invite submissions for the Research and Innovation Track, welcoming groundbreaking research contributions, innovative solutions, and experimental studies relevant to the Semantic Web, Semantic Technologies, and AI-enabled semantics. We also encourage submissions at the intersections of these fields with other scientific and applied disciplines, fostering cross-disciplinary exchange and advancement. Papers should present original work that has not been published or is not under consideration elsewhere. All submissions must adhere to the submission guidelines, including reference formatting and any additional documentation as required. Each submission will undergo a rigorous review process, with at least three independent reviews, evaluating the novelty, technical quality, reproducibility, and practical relevance of the work.

## Topics of Interest

SEMANTiCS 2025 calls for submissions of high-quality research papers across a broad spectrum of topics in Semantic Web, Semantic Technologies, and AI. We are particularly interested in new and emerging trends, especially where semantic technologies intersect with evolving fields such as large language models, explainable AI, and trustworthy data infrastructures. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

-   Semantic Interoperability (e.g., cross-domain standards, mapping frameworks, ontology alignment)
-   Linked Data storage, triple stores, graph databases
-   Robust, Scalable, and Fault-Tolerant Semantic Data Systems (e.g., distributed querying, optimization)
-   User Interfaces and Usability of Semantic Technologies (e.g., visualizations, intelligent user interaction)
-   Explainable and Interoperable AI
-   Decentralised and Federated Knowledge Graphs (e.g., federated querying, link traversal)

Applied Semantic Technologies and AI in Real-World Scenarios, such as, but not limited to:

-   Biomedicine and Health (e.g., Knowledge Graphs for biomedical applications, AI-driven diagnostics, personalized health)
-   AI for Environmental and Climate Solutions (e.g., semantic modeling for environmental impact, biodiversity knowledge graphs)
-   Scientific Knowledge Graphs and Open Science (e.g., FAIR data principles, enhanced scholarly communication)
-   Semantic Technologies in GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums)
-   Knowledge Graphs and Hybrid AI for Industry 4.0/5.0 and Predictive Maintenance
-   Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage Preservation
-   Legal Technology, AI Ethics, and Regulatory Compliance (e.g., AI and legal frameworks, semantic-enabled compliance with the EU AI Act)
-   Economics and Governance of Data Ecosystems (e.g., data marketplaces, semantic service interoperability, data policy)

## Submission Guidelines

The Research and Innovation Track at SEMANTiCS 2025 invites both <b>long</b> and <b>short paper submissions</b>.

-   **Long papers** should be **12-15 pages** in length (excluding references). These submissions are expected to present comprehensive, mature research findings, including in-depth theoretical or practical insights.
-   **Short papers** should be a **maximum of 6 pages** (excluding references). These submissions can include preliminary findings, innovative ideas, or position papers that aim to spark discussion and exploration.

References are not included in the page count, so authors may add additional pages for relevant citations if needed. This flexibility allows authors to fully reference foundational and related work to strengthen the context and impact of their research.

-   Submissions should follow the guidelines of IOS Press. Details are available at https://www.iospress.com/book-article-instructions.
-   Authors need to use the [Word template](https://www.iospress.com/sites/default/files/media/files/2022-06/ECRC-Author-Instructions-and-tools-Word.zip) or [LaTeX](https://vtex-soft.github.io/texsupport.IOS-Book-Article/) template provided by IOS Press. Overleaf users can copy the project [from here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gkkspcvjgwxv#563836) (follow instructions in the abstract).
-   Abstract submission is mandatory for all papers. To aid the review and bidding process, we highly encourage authors to submit structured abstracts (follow the instructions [here](https://2025-eu.semantics.cc/page/cfp_abstract))
-   All papers and abstracts have to be submitted electronically via EasyChair.
-   Submissions must be in English.
-   Submissions must adhere to the fair use of Large Language Models. Please refer to the SEMANTiCS [full policy](https://2025-eu.semantics.cc/page/llm-policy) for more details.
-   Submissions must be anonymous; the reviewing process is double-blind, but reviewers will be able to disclose their identities if they wish, by signing their reviews.
-   Accepted papers will be published in open access proceedings by IOS Press, and the text of all the reviews (excluding the scores) of all the accepted papers will be posted on the conference website and will be archived on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) as publicly available material.
-   At least one author of each accepted paper must present it in person and therefore register for the conference at the ONSITE rate.
-   All authors are strongly suggested to provide optional links to code, materials, and datasets during the submission process - we will have specific optional fields in the EasyChair submission form - the review process will take these into account when provided. To anonymise resources for the reviewing process, authors can use services like [Anonymous GitHub](https://anonymous.4open.science/) or figshare/Zenodo as described [here](https://github.com/dgraziotin/disclose-data-dbr-first-then-opendata?tab=readme-ov-file#double-blind-data-submission-on-zenodo).
-   The Research and Innovation Track will not accept papers that, at the time of submission, are under review or have already been published in or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference.
-   All authors will have the opportunity to provide an ORKG comparison in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (https://orkg.org) during the submission process - we will have a specific optional field in the EasyChair submission form.

## Review and Evaluation Criteria

Each submission will be reviewed by at least three Programme Committee members. The reviewing process is double-blind. However, reviewers can disclose their identity by signing their reviews and/or adding one of their persistent identifiers (e.g. their ORCID).

The text of all the reviews (excluding the scores) of all the accepted papers will be posted on the conference website with the basic bibliographic metadata of the reviewed submission (i.e. title and authors), and it will be archived on Zenodo as publicly available material. All the signed reviews of the accepted papers will be licensed using a Creative Commons Attribution license (CC-BY, the copyright holder will be the reviewer), except the anonymous ones that will be released in CC0.

Papers submitted to this track will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

-   Appropriateness
-   Originality, novelty, and innovativeness
-   Impact of results
-   Technical quality of the methods
-   Soundness of the evaluation
-   Proper comparison to related work
-   Clarity and quality of writing
-   Reproducibility of results and resources

**We look forward to receiving your contributions!**
