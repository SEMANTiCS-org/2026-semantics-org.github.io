# Industry & Use Case Presentations

The Industry &amp; Use Case track at SEMANTiCS welcomes submissions that present use cases and industry adoption of semantic technology. Solutions that deal with semantic processing of data and/or information in areas like Linked Data, Knowledge Graphs, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Publishing, Thesaurus and/or Ontology management, and any related fields. All submissions have a strong focus on real world applications beyond the prototypical status and demonstrate the power of semantic systems!

## Important dates

-   **Presentation Ready:** August 18, 2025 (11:59 pm)

All deadlines are set for 11:59 pm, Anywhere On Earth time (UTC-12)

**Submission via Easychair on [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semantics2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semantics2025).** Please notice that a paper abstract is not necessary, as your submission will only include a presentation at SEMANTiCS and not a paper. Any submission should contain a summary of 200 to 300 words that will be used in the final program. Your submission must also include a full page description of the use case you want to present, in particular: initial situation, approach, business value and benefits of the semantic solution, prospects and recommendation. Submissions that don’t meet these requirements cannot be taken into account.

Via Easychair, you can enter your summary in the field “Abstract”, and the full page description via the “upload paper” button. The summary will appear in the program on the webpage, the full page description will only be used in the selection process.

-   Enterprise Knowledge Graphs, Graph Data Management
-   Machine Learning Techniques for/using Knowledge Graphs (e.g. reinforcement learning, deep learning, data mining and knowledge discovery)
-   Knowledge Management (e.g. acquisition, capture, extraction, authoring, integration, publication)
-   Reasoning, rules and policies
-   Web Semantics & Linked (Open) Data
-   Natural Language Processing for/using Knowledge Graphs
-   Crowdsourcing for/using Knowledge Graphs
-   Semantics in Data Science
-   Trust, Data Privacy, and Security with Semantic Technologies
-   Authentication of knowledge graphs
-   IoT and Stream Processing, Linked Data Event Streams
-   Conversational AI and Dialogue Systems
-   Provenance and Data Change Tracking
-   Semantic Interoperability (via mapping, crosswalks, standards, etc.)

## Author Guidelines and Submission

-   This call for presentations reaches out to professionals in the areas related to the topics of SEMANTiCS for proposals to present industry implementations, best practices and use case prototypes, to discuss semantic systems in birds-of-a-feather sessions as well as informal settings. Additionally, we explicitly encourage the submission of software applications, apps or services that demonstrate the usefulness and benefits of semantic technologies and semantic data management.
-   To contribute a submission for a presentation at SEMANTiCS 2025 please prepare the following: Fill out the online application at Easychair and give us relevant information about your expertise and your professional background.
-   Please notice that a paper abstract is not necessary, as your submission will only include a presentation at SEMANTiCS and not a paper.

-   Via Easychair, you can enter your summary in the field “Abstract”, and the full page description via the “upload paper” button. The summary will appear in the program on the webpage, the full page description will only be used in the selection process.
-   All accepted submissions will be granted a presentation slot at the main conference. Please stick to this time pattern when preparing your talk. This is the only way we can guarantee a smooth and satisfying programme and allow all conference participants to attend as many slots as possible without missing important information.
-   Submissions must adhere to the fair use of Large Language Models. Please refer to the SEMANTiCS full policy for more details: https://2025-eu.semantics.cc/page/llm-policy

When your submission is accepted and you are preparing your talk, please take care to address the following aspects:

-   _Initial Situation_  
     What kind of challenge did you face in the beginning of the project? What problems needed to be solved?
-   _Approach and IT-Solution_  
     Which approach and methodology has been chosen to tackle the problem(s)? How is your solution composed with respect to technological aspects / human aspects / organisational aspects? How do the semantic components support the process from data to knowledge?
-   _Success Criteria for / Benefit of the Semantic Solution_  
     Which factors (conscious and unconscious) have been crucial to the success of your project? Which obstacles did you face? How can you measure the benefit of your solution? How does the organisation benefit from your solution?
-   _Prospects and Recommendations_  
     What are the next steps planned in your project? Can you give recommendations with respect to development / deployment of semantic solutions within organisational / corporate settings?
-   _Demo (if applicable)_  
     Prepare a short demonstration of your tool / service.

## Review and Evaluation Criteria

Every submission will be reviewed by the Programme Committee.

Submissions to this track will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

-   Your presentation is relevant to industry and industrial purposes. It illustrates how semantic technologies / solutions contribute to or improve existing businesses and / or generate new ones.
-   The presented solution has already been deployed and / or has been tested in a practical environment – at least prototypically.
-   Your presentation is well-structured and does bring across its message.
-   The topic is well described and covers enough explanations, examples, use cases, graphics, etc.
-   Novelty: The topic covered is new to your industry – not necessarily new to business in general

In case your presentation will be accepted, we will provide you with detailed information on organisational matters according to the selection of submissions and conference participation.

## Your Benefit

An industry and use case presentation allows your organisation or project to advance and promote your topics and gain increased visibility. It gives you the chance to network with experts in a variety of fields. These relationships provide great value to organisations as they encounter subtle technical issues in any stage of implementation. The expertise gained by SEMANTiCS attendees has a long-term impact on their careers and organisations. These factors make SEMANTiCS for our community the major industry related event across Europe.

Presenters will have the possibility to discuss their contributions with an interested audience and exchange ideas on how semantic technologies can be utilized for corporate and business needs more effectively and successfully. Besides that, the Industry Presentations at SEMANTiCS generate a high visibility within the Semantics Community and allow you to meet interesting experts and extend your business network.

We are looking forward to your contribution!
