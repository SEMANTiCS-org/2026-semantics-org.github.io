# Improving peer-review with the Open Research Knowledge Graph

The <a href="https://orkg.org/" target="_blank">Open Research Knowledge Graph</a> (ORKG) and the organizing committee of SEMANTiCS 2025 are collaborating to empower the authors and peer reviewers alike. Peer-review is a critical checkpoint for validating the integrity and novelty of scientific contributions. However, the process of peer-review suffers from challenges such as reviewer fatigue and the difficulty in distinguishing true advancements in a field. The ORKG aims to make a transformative impact to refine the peer-review process and enrich the ecosystem of scientific communication, through its structured comparisons. These comparisons organize research contributions in a tabular format, offering a clear overview of the field and can be enhanced with visualizations like bar charts or scatter plots for a more intuitive grasp of the data.

Open Research Knowledge Graph: A lighthouse in the publication flood

The ORKG facilitates a more efficient and insightful peer-review process by offering a platform where researchers can systematically describe and assess their work. For peer reviewers, it provides a concise characterization of submissions by comparing them with related approaches. This not only aids in identifying the unique contributions of a paper but also in understanding its position within the state-of-the-art through ORKG comparisons. These comparisons are not just auxiliary tools; they are recognized as scholarly outputs in their own right, complete with Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for easy citation. This feature underscores the ORKGâ€™s potential to enhance the visibility and credibility of research contributions.</p>
