<p style="text-align: justify;">
    We are excited to announce the workshops &amp; tutorials accepted for
    <a href="https://2024-eu.semantics.cc/page/accepted_workshops_tutorials">
        SEMANTiCS 2024
    </a>
    ! This year, the line-up includes one popular workshop making its return
    along with four brand-new ones and three tutorials, all on trending and
    relevant topics.  Let’s dive into the details.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    The
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/3rdnlp4kgc/home">
        3rd NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge
    </a>
    will make its third rerun in this year's SEMANTiCS after two successful
    editions last year at
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nlp4kg">
        TheWebConf 2023
    </a>
    and at
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/2nd-nlp4kgc/home">
        SEMANTiCS 2023
    </a>
    . Consistently with the previous editions, the NLP4KGC 2024 workshop focuses
    on methods and approaches of knowledge and data extraction from text, as
    well as theoretical and practical aspects of using semantics and Natural
    Language Processing for Knowledge Graph creation and the use of such
    knowledge graphs for Graph Neural Network (GNN) tasks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    The
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/semanticmaterials">
        International Workshop on Semantic Materials Science: Harnessing the
        Power of Semantic Web (SeMats)
    </a>
    aims to explore the application of Semantic Web technologies in Materials
    Science to enhance data interoperability and traceability and foster
    automatable data management solutions. By bringing together experts from
    both fields, the workshop seeks to showcase existing approaches, foster
    collaboration, and make these technologies more accessible to the broader
    research community, ultimately paving the way for more efficient and
    interconnected scientific research.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    The
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/llmskgs">
        Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs Unified: use cases and
        examples
    </a>
    workshop explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
    Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to generate practical business value while ensuring
    Responsible AI. By focusing on real-world use cases presented by experts
    from industry, governmental organisations and academia, the workshop aims to
    demonstrate how LLMs and KGs can be effectively combined.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    The
    <a href="https://w3id.org/nxdg/2024">
        NXDG: NeXt-Generation Data Governance
    </a>
    workshop aims to address the challenges of data governance in the evolving
    landscape of data protection laws and the emergence of data spaces, focusing
    on creating trustful, interoperable, and legally aligned data ecosystems.
    NXDG, seeks to develop solutions that manage data, policies, and legal
    documentation in compliance with European regulations by bringing together
    experts from technical, legal, and societal fields, thus benefiting data
    providers, consumers, and all stakeholders in the Data Space era.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Finally, the
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/skgi">
        First International Workshop on Scaling Knowledge Graphs for Industry
    </a>
    workshop aims to explore and advance the scalability of Knowledge Graph
    systems in industrial settings, moving beyond storage and retrieval tasks to
    address real-world challenges in processing, streaming, and data ingestion.
    The goal is to foster discussion on how to make Knowledge Graphs work
    effectively at an industrial scale, enabling broader and more impactful use
    cases.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    On the tutorial side of the spectrum,
    <a
        href="https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/events/semantics24-the-ultimate-guide-to-semantic-reasoning-how-to-enrich-your-data-for-practical-applications-including-use-with-rag-llms"
    >
        the Ultimate Guide to Semantic Reasoning: How to enrich your data for
        practical applications including use with RAG &amp; LLMs
    </a>
    tutorial aims to equip participants with the knowledge and skills to harness
    semantic reasoning for enhancing Knowledge Graph applications, improving
    data quality, and accelerating query performance. Participants will learn
    best practices in rule writing, ontological reasoning with OWL, and advanced
    functionalities with Datalog, gaining hands-on experience to apply these
    techniques in real-world applications, including RAG and LLM-based
    solutions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Then, the tutorial on
    <a
        href="https://pantopix.com/en/modeling-product-ontologies-for-industrial-kg-applications/"
    >
        Modelling product ontologies for industrial KG applications
    </a>
    aims to explore and harmonize approaches to product ontology modelling in
    industrial Knowledge Graph applications, where delivering the correct
    information at the right time is crucial. Participants will examine
    standards like iiRDS, Asset Administration Shell, and custom ontologies to
    identify commonalities and differences and to develop a unified framework
    for product ontology modelling to enhance data interoperability.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Finally, the tutorial on
    <a href="https://www.semantic-treehouse.nl/blog/semantics-2024/">
        Semantics in Data Spaces: Semantic Treehouse as Vocabulary Hub
    </a>
    focuses on achieving semantic interoperability within European data spaces,
    which is crucial for secure and trustworthy data sharing that drives
    innovation. Participants will explore practical approaches, including TNO’s
    Semantic Treehouse, to balance uniformity and diversity in semantics,
    ensuring consistent and unambiguous data exchanges in distributed systems.
