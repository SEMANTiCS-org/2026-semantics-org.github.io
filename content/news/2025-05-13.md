<p>Navigating the vast ocean of scholarly literature can feel overwhelming as the scientific output accelerates at an unprecedented pace and complexity. Traditional, document-centric approaches to scientific publishing, static metadata, and scattered data often hinder discovery, synthesis, and reuse. The <a href="https://orkg.org/">Open Research Knowledge Graph</a> (ORKG) offers a groundbreaking infrastructure that transforms scientific publications into semantically described, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)-compliant machine-actionable research objects. Semantic descriptions of research problems, methods, results, and other salient features enable comparative overviews across multiple papers in a discipline. Unlike traditional document-centric approaches, ORKG captures knowledge in a live knowledge graph that enables dynamic, fine-grained, interoperable, and comparable representations of research content.</p>

<p>Authors submitting papers to SEMANTiCS 2025 can directly contribute to and benefit from the ORKG using cutting-edge semantic tools and frameworks. We invite the authors to semantically enrich their submissions using state-of-the-art <a href="https://academy.orkg.org/orkg-academy/main/courses/comparison-course.html">ORKG Comparisons</a> to contextualize their work. For more information please check out our tutorial <a href="https://orkg.org/help-center/article/17/How-to_and_demonstration_videos">here</a>. Using the ORKG Comparisons, authors can highlight how their submitted contribution relates to existing studies in the discipline. Structured comparisons in the ORKG.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Show key differences in, e.g., methods, results, and datasets.</li>
  <li>Position novel findings in the research landscape.</li>
  <li>Let other researchers easily compare, contrast, and discover current work, thereby improving the peer-review process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although semantic enhancement of submission is optional, we highly encourage authors to participate in building a more open and machine-readable scientific future. ORKG Comparisons are not merely semantic  add-ons to your submissions, they are recognized valuable scholarly outputs, each with its own DOI, making your work more visible, citable, and impactful in the research ecosystem. The most outstanding ORKG Comparison will receive a “Best ORKG Comparison Award” and a cash prize.</p>

<p>Your paper deserves more than static PDF status. By semantically enriching your work through an ORKG Comparison, you empower machines and humans  to understand, reuse, and build upon your ideas. Let’s shape the future of scholarly communication at SEMANTiCS 2025 - with your research in the ORKG. </p>
