The 21st edition of the SEMANTiCS conference is coming to Vienna in September 2025 — and this year, more than ever, we’re calling on the collective brilliance of diverse communities to shape what’s next. Because **semantics isn’t just a tool. It’s the foundation of intelligence.**

Human intelligence is inseparable from meaning. We don’t just perceive patterns — we interpret them. From the way we learn language to how we form concepts, make decisions, or collaborate, semantics is the invisible thread that turns raw perception into understanding. The same holds for nature itself: in biological systems, meaning emerges through interaction, context, and structured communication. To build machines that approach anything resembling general intelligence, we must move beyond surface-level mimicry and toward systems that encode, share, and reason over meaning. Semantics provides the structure for this — not as an afterthought, but as a core principle of intelligence itself.

Similarly, towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and in the era of agentic AI — systems that don’t just respond but reason, plan, and act — semantics is the key to grounding machine understanding in meaning, not just pattern. It connects the dots between data and decisions, between symbols and actions. From knowledge graphs and ontology engineering to generative AI with memory and intent, the technologies we explore at SEMANTiCS are no longer just enablers; they are core drivers of the next generation of intelligent systems.
**SEMANTiCS 2025** is both for the insiders of the semantic web community. It's a call for convergence — where deep learning meets deep meaning, where symbolic meets neural, where actionable intelligence begins with structured knowledge.

We’ve assembled an exceptional lineup of keynotes, featuring thought leaders across disciplines who are shaping the future of AI with rigor, creativity, and purpose. Every talk, every discussion, every submitted paper will contribute to the larger vision: intelligent systems that don’t just process data, but understand context, reason ethically, and collaborate with humans in meaningful ways.
As AI moves toward greater autonomy, explainability, and real-world deployment, the role of semantics is intensifying. The future of AI is interpretable, interoperable, and knowledge-aware. Let’s build that future together.
