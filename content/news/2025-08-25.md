# Bilateral AI Cluster of Excellence at SEMANTiCS 2025
##### August 25, 2025 by SEMANTiCS

The [Bilateral AI](https://www.bilateral-ai.net/home) Austrian Science Fund (FWF) Cluster of Excellence is conducting fundamental research into the combination of symbolic and sub-symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) in a manner that lays the foundations for Broad AI with greater problem solving capabilities and generalisability ability. 
Towards this end, [BILAIs research agenda](https://www.bilateral-ai.net/research/research-modules) is organised around eight core research modules that place specific emphasis on graph-based structures, context, knowledge & learning, reasoning, causality, explainable AI, ethical AI systems, and demonstration & benchmarking.

Graphs in machine learning and symbolic AI are inherently robust as discrete structures and can be readily adapted to new situations making them particularly suitable in a Broad AI context. Consequently, Knowledge Graphs and graph-based models, based on abstractions of real world entities, are prevalent across the various BILAI research models.

[Accorrding to Sahar Vahdati](https://2025-eu.semantics.cc/page/news?page=2025-04-7), the SEMANTiCS 2025 Conference Chair, SEMANTiCS is ***“where deep learning meets deep meaning, where symbolic meets neural, where actionable intelligence begins with structured knowledge”*** . This convergence is at the core of BILAI, and is actively driving our research agenda. Thus it is not surprising that this years SEMANTiCS conference will showcase various BILAI activities: 

- [Georg Gottlob](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/people/georg-gottlob) (BILAI Key Researcher, TU Wien) will give a keynote entitled [***“Psychoanalysis (and Therapy) of LLMs with Special Regard to their Use for Knowledge Graph Construction and Curation”***](https://2025-eu.semantics.cc/page/speakers?page=1B54Z5MM4JztjGL7j9lJMc8NMMbL7RjFo). Georg and his team are exploring the potential of large language models as a means to automatically verify and enhance relational databases and Knowledge Graphs, while mitigating veracity issues caused by missing, incorrect, or biased training data. 

- [Emanuel Sallinger](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/people/emanuel-sallinger) (BILAI Key Researcher, TU Wien) and Luigi Bellomarini (Bank of Italy) will present their work on “<u>From Strings to Things and Back: Putting Logic-based Reasoning into Action in a Central Bank</u>”. Emanuel recounts that “***together with our BILAI industrial research partner, the Central Bank of Italy, we showcase Bilateral AI in practice with putting both ‘strings’ technology (MachineLearning and Large Language Models) and ‘things’ technology (KnowledgeGraphs and Logic) together in widely deployed real-world applications***". Furthermore, the talk will discuss the evolving role of logic-based reasoning systems based on Knowledge Graphs and their efforts to balance data-driven, deterministic, and explainable nature of deductive reasoning with the flexibility of modern natural language processing.

- [Marta Sabou](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/dpkm/team/sabou-marta) (BILAI Key Researcher, WU Wien) together with her [Leveraging Semantics for Transparency in Industrial Systems (SENTIS) workshop](https://semsys.ai.wu.ac.at/sentis2025/) co-organisers will bring together researchers, industry professionals, and domain experts who specialise in semantic web technologies for automation systems. The overarching goal of the workshop is to facilitate transparency in both automation systems and their AI models, while promoting explainable solutions for industry applications. Marta highlights the fact that “***the SENTIS workshop, which is co-organised with colleagues from Siemens, focuses on the domain of industrial systems such as smart grids and buildings and investigates how AI technologies can render these systems more transparent and user friendly. As such, it provides interesting use cases for BILAI***”.

- [Fajar J. Ekaputra](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/dpkm/team/fajar-juang-ekaputra) (BILAI Assistant Professor, WU Wien) is one of the organisers of the “[Knowledge Graphs and Neurosymbolic AI (KG-NeSy)](https://sites.google.com/view/kgnesy2025)” workshop that aims to gain a better understanding of how Knowledge Graphs and Neurosymbolic AI influence and benefit each other. The workshop is organised around three overarching topics Neurosymbolic AI for Knowledge Engineering; Knowledge Graphs and Neurosymbolic approaches for Robust; Trustworthy and Interpretable AI; and Application of Neurosymbolic AI and Knowledge Graphs. When asked about the link between KG-NeSy and BILAI Fajar explains that “***the workshop is strongly aligned with BILAI’s mission of investigating bilateral (i.e., neurosymbolic) AI technologies and its applications with a focus on the role of Knowledge Graphs in these systems***".

- [Daniil Dobriy](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/dpkm/team/dobriy) (BILAI PhD Student, WU Wien) is a co-organiser of the [International workshop on Symbolic and Generative AI for Science (SymGenAI4Sci)](https://sga4s.semantic.foundation/), which explores the transformative potential of generative AI in scientific research. According to Daniil “***Science is inherently generative: it involves creating hypotheses, designing experiments, interpreting data, and communicating results. Generative AI has the potential to augment these processes by automating routine tasks, enabling hypothesis generation, synthesizing complex information, and uncovering insights from vast datasets***”. Open challenges include dealing with data sparsity, noisiness, and specificity, as well as developing models that understand and adhere to rigorous scientific principles and constraints. 

I’m looking forward to hearing about cutting-edge advancements in Knowledge Graphs and AI and discussing foundational aspects of Broad AI with SEMANTIC 2025 participants from academia, industry, and public sector organizations.
