    schema:abstract """Purpose: A previous paper proposed the usage of SHACL to assess the FAIRness of software repositories. Following this call to action, this paper introduces and discusses the changes made to QUARE, a SHACL-based tool for validating GitHub repositories against sets of quality criteria, to facilitate this task.
Methodology: An operationalization of the abstract FAIR best practices from previous work is devised to enable a FAIRness assessment based on concrete quality criteria. Afterwards, a SHACL shapes graph implementing these constraints is introduced, followed by a discussion of the efficient generation of suitable RDF representations for GitHub repositories. Improvements regarding the usability of QUARE are examined, as well. An evaluation on the FAIRness of 223 GitHub repositories and on the runtime performance of the assessment is conducted.
Findings: Trending repositories comply with fewer FAIR best practices than repositories expected to be FAIR on average. However, the latter still exhibit deficiencies, for example, regarding the correct application of semantic versioning. The low average runtime of the FAIRness assessment of respectively 3.94 and 6.20 seconds per repository permits the integration of QuaRe in, e.g., CI/CD pipelines.
Value: The FAIR principles are often mentioned as a measure to tackle the reproducibility crisis, which continues to have a significant impact on science. To implement these principles in practice, it is crucial to provide tools that facilitate the automated assessment of the FAIRness of software repositories. The enhanced version of QUARE introduced in this paper represents our proposal for this demand.""" ;

an international cross-broader multilingual setting. Here, legal documents are orig-

    schema:abstract """Background: The increasing demand for advanced image understanding, particularly in detecting abstract concepts (AC) in images, presents a multifaceted challenge both technically and ethically for humans and machines alike. This demand highlights the necessity for innovative and more interpretable approaches that reconcile traditional deep vision methods with the nuanced knowledge required to interpret images at such high semantic levels.

Objective: To bridge the gap between deep vision and situated perceptual paradigms, this study aims to establish a situated knowledge graph (KG) for a deeper understanding of abstract concept (AC) evocation in cultural images. Leveraging this knowledge, the objective is to enhance performance and interpretability in AC image classification.

Methods: We construct the ARTstract Knowledge Graph (AKG), capturing perceptual semantics from over 14,000 cultural images labeled with ACs. We extract perceptual semantic units using off-the-shelf models and integrate them into the AKG, enriching it with high-level linguistic frames. For AC-based image classification, we adopt a hybrid approach, integrating knowledge graphs and visual transformers. Specifically, we compute knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) on AKG and fuse them with visual transformer embeddings. For interpretability, we conduct post-hoc qualitative analyses by probing model similarities with training instances.

Results: Our hybrid methods outperform existing techniques in abstract concept (AC) image classification. Through post hoc interpretability analyses, we reveal the deep visual model's proficiency in capturing low-level visual attributes, contrasting with our method's efficacy in representing abstract and semantic scene elements.

Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the synergy and complementarity between KGE embeddings' situated perceptual knowledge and deep visual model's sensory-perceptual understanding, showcasing the potential of neuro-symbolic methods for robust image representation in intricate visual comprehension tasks.

A frequently overlooked aspect of entity linking is the potential encounter with entities not yet present in a target knowledge graph. Although some recent studies have addressed this issue, they primarily utilize full-text knowledge bases or depend on external information.
However, these resources are not available in most use cases. In this work, we solely rely on the information within a knowledge graph and assume no external information is accessible.

To investigate the challenge of identifying and disambiguating entities absent from the knowledge graph, we introduce a comprehensive silver-standard benchmark dataset that covers texts from 1999 to 2022. 
Based on our novel dataset, we develop an approach using pre-trained language models and knowledge graph embeddings without the need for a parallel full-text corpus.
Moreover, by assessing the influence of knowledge graph embeddings on the given task, we show that implementing a sequential entity linking approach, which considers the whole sentence, can outperform clustering techniques that handle each mention separately in specific instances.""" ;

    schema:abstract "To advance the adoption of linked data in the context of the Dutch Federated Data System (Dutch synonym: FDS), it is necessary to have robust access control for native linked data sources. For this purpose, research was initiated to assess whether it is feasible to implement access controls on linked data sources in this context. A four-phase design science research methodology is applied. The first phase defines both the question guiding this research and the context in which the research was conducted. The second phase includes a review of the state-of-the-art and an evaluation of the existing approaches to access control could support the FDS use case. Having determined that no existing approaches completely fulfil the requirements of the FDS use case, the third phase describes a prototype enforcement mechanism designed and developed as part of this research. The fourth and final phase evaluates this protype with respect to its feasibility to support the requirements of the FDS context. At present, there are no standardized solutions for securing native linked data sources. Existing literature and industry examples from the Netherlands and Europe highlight several potential solution directions for access control on SPARQL endpoints. These solution directions are used as inspiration for the development of a prototype enforcement mechanism. This prototype shows potential when applied to the Dutch Federated Data System and suggests a more generic approach could be taken when applying these controls to a broader context. Further research, testing and standardization efforts are required to bring such an approach to maturity. Any linked data ecosystem containing closed information requires a robust approach to access control. This research contributes to the existing literature on approaches taken to such access controls and highlights the increasing need for, and the feasibility of implementing, these controls in governmental contexts. Bringing such a solution to maturity would support wider adoption of linked data technologies in this context." ;

    schema:abstract """Traditional dataset retrieval systems rely on metadata for indexing, rather than on the underlying data values. However, high-quality metadata creation and enrichment often require manual annotations, which is a labour-intensive and challenging process to automate. In this study, we propose a method to support metadata enrichment using topic annotations generated by three Large Language Models (LLMs): ChatGPT-3.5, GoogleBard, and GoogleGemini. Our analysis focusses on classifying column headers based on domain-specific topics from the Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA), a Linked Data controlled vocabulary. Our approach operates in a zero-shot setting, integrating the controlled topic vocabulary directly within the input prompt. This integration serves as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, with the aim of improving the results of the topic classification task.

We evaluated the performance of the LLMs in terms of internal consistency, inter-machine alignment, and agreement with human classification. Additionally, we investigate the impact of contextual information (i.e., dataset description) on the classification outcomes. Our findings suggest that ChatGPT and GoogleGemini outperform GoogleBard in terms of internal consistency as well as LLM-human-alignment. Interestingly, we found that contextual information had no significant impact on LLM performance. 

This work proposes a novel approach that leverages LLMs for topic classification of column headers using a controlled vocabulary, presenting a practical application of LLMs and RAG systems within the Semantic Web domain. This approach has the potential to facilitate automated metadata enrichment, thereby enhancing dataset retrieval and the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) of research data on the Web.""" ;

With increasing size of Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs, the resulting graph structures can become too large to be managed on a single compute node, lacking the necessary resources to execute a partitioning of the graph -- in particular, when the partitioning method relies on global graph information for which the entire graph has to be loaded into the main memory. This paper introduces a window-based streaming partitioning technique to obtain distributed RDF graphs, overcoming the memory limitations of traditional partitioning methods.
Methodology:
We evaluated our approach, UniPart, by comparing it with established graph partitioning algorithms such as METIS, LDG, and WStream. The comparison focused on key metrics, including the proportion of edge cuts.
Findings:
Through practical assessments using the LUBM dataset, our algorithm demonstrated strong performance in load balance, execution time, and memory usage. Notably, under the DFS streaming order, UniPart achieved a 20\\% reduction in edge-cut ratio compared to LDG.
Value:
UniPart operates without the need for global graph information, making it exceptionally suited for dynamic environments with unbounded streams and unpredictable data sizes.

reuse existing ontologies and extend them to create the SRI ontology. Findings:
The model is published according to the FAIR principles. Moreover, it is flexible to

    schema:abstract "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are relational knowledge bases that represent facts as a set of labelled nodes and the labelled relations between them. Their machine learning counterpart, Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs), learn to predict new facts based on the data contained in a KG -- the so-called link prediction task. To date, almost all forms of link prediction for KGs rely on some form of embedding model, and KGEs hold state-of-the-art status for link prediction. In this paper, we present TWIG-I (Topologically-Weighted Intelligence Generation for Inference), a novel link prediction system that can represent the features of a KG in latent space without using node or edge embeddings. We show that TWIG-I can increase performance on the link prediction relative to KGE models, including a 35 base-point increase in MRR performance on FB15k-237 over the strongest baseline; this represents a 100% relative increase in performance. Unlike KGEs, TWIG-I can be natively used for transfer learning across KGs, even across KGs that come from different knowledge domains. We show that using transfer learning with TWIG-I can lead to notable increases in performance both over KGE baselines and over TWIG-I models trained without finetuning. With finetuning, TWIG-I is able to achieve a 44 base-point increase in MRR over the standard benchmark KG FB15k-237 relative to the strongest baseline, which corresponds to a 126% relative increase in predictive performance." ;

    schema:abstract "The interoperability of domain ontologies, developed by domain experts, necessitates their alignment before attempting to match them. Within these ontologies, defined concepts often encounter an ambiguity problem stemming from the use of natural language. This interoperability issue raises the underlying ontology matching (OM) challenge. OM might be defined as the identification of correspondences or relationships between two or more entities, such as classes or properties among two or more ontologies. Rule-based ontology matching approaches, e.g., LogMap and AML have not outperformed machine learning based matchers on the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) benchmark datasets, especially on the OAEI Conference Track since 2020. Supervised machine or deep learning approaches produce the best results but require labeled training datasets. In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), robust zero-shot prompting of LLMs can also return convincing responses. While prompt generation requires prompt template engineering by domain experts, contextual information about the concepts to be aligned can be retrieved by leveraging graph search algorithms. In this work, we explore how graph search algorithms, namely (i) random walk and (ii) tree traversal can be utilized to retrieve the contextual information to be incorporated into prompt templates. Through these algorithms, our approach refrains from considering all triples connected with a concept to be aligned in its contextual information creation. Our experiments show that including the retrieved contextual information in prompt templates improves the matcher's performance. Additionally, our approach outperforms previous works leveraging zero-shot prompting." ;

However, considering the overlap, a subset of these sources might already be sufficient to obtain a complete answer. Further, we deliberately might not wish to include all sources in the evaluation and make a decision based the reliability of a source. We therefore present ORAQL (an Overlap and Reliability Aware Query Processing Layer), an approach that exploits statistics capturing the overlap between sources to choose a subset of the available sources in the federation to compute a complete answer while minimizing redundant answers. Moreover, a user-provided reliability goal is taken into account. Hence, we propose an approach based on a majority vote over multiple sources to increase the reliability of the query result. For this work, we focus on TPF interfaces, since they are the least expressive interfaces and hence our approach can easily be adopted for more expressive interfaces, e.g. SPARQL endpoints. The presented methods to capture the overlap between sources of a federation have shown to generate useful overlap profiles with a maximum deviation of less than five percent. Even if the identification of redundant data is NP-hard we presented an approximation with a significant reduction in requested endpoints. Further, we have shown that ORAQL is granularly tunable towards reliability and can beat a state-of-the-art baseline system in terms of coverage and reliability." ;

    schema:abstract "Relational graph convolutional networks (RGCNs) have been successful in learning from knowledge graphs. However, training on large-scale knowledge graphs becomes challenging due to the exponential growth of the neighborhood size across the network layers. Moreover, knowledge graphs have multiple relations, and often, the literals can have multimodal content; these properties make it extra challenging to scale up the training of RGCNs to large-scale graphs. Graph sampling techniques have been shown to be effective in scaling learning to large graphs by reducing the number of processed nodes and lowering memory usage. However, only a few studies have focused on sampling for knowledge graphs. In this work, we introduce ReWise, a relation-wise sampling framework that includes a family of sampling methods designed for knowledge graphs. Our experiments demonstrate that sampling reduces memory usage up to 50% lower than the case without sampling while maintaining the same classification accuracy and, in some cases, outperforming it. Additionally, we show that our sampling strategy is compatible with the multimodal RGCN, showing the same behavior as RGCNs." ;

    schema:abstract "Sustainability reporting by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is gaining importance. SMEs form the backbone of European industries, and their customers rely on them to ensure regulatory compliance. In preparing sustainability reports, a combination of standards is commonly used, which encompasses overlapping yet distinct requirements on sustainability indicators. Different standards categorize shared indicators under varying topics, while they also mandate unique indicators to assess identical sustainability phenomena. This poses challenges for SMEs in reporting against multiple standards. Considerable human efforts are demanded to determine the interconnected requirements across different standards. Additionally, reporting on overlapping indicators for new standards results in significant redundant work. Mapping of indicators between different standards allows the semantic interoperability of standards by indicating matching and distinct requirements, aiding in addressing these challenges. Therefore, this paper focuses on developing an ontology for mapping indicators from two significant standards, GRI and ESRS. We introduce the Sustainability Reporting Standards Ontology (RSO). RSO formally represents environmental indicators in GRI and ESRS, emphasizing indicator requirements such as unit, quantity, and measurement variables. RSO is implemented in the RDF/OWL format and will be made available online. Furthermore, we provide an ontology-based mapping between indicators, supported by concrete examples that illustrate the interconnections between them." ;

We propose here a method to significantly reduce the size of the used graphs to focus on a useful part in a given usage context. We define the notion of context graph as an extract from one or more general knowledge bases (such as DBpedia, Wikidata, Yago) that contains the set of information relevant to a specific domain while preserving the properties of the original graph. We validate the approach on a DBpedia excerpt for entities related to the Data\\&Musée project and the KORE reference set according to two aspects: the coverage of the context graph and the preservation of the similarity between its entities. The results show that the use of context graphs makes the exploitation of large knowledge bases more manageable and efficient while preserving the properties of the initial graph." ;

    schema:abstract """Purpose:
Sparql is a highly expressive query language for knowledge graphs; yet, formulating precise Sparql queries can be challenging for users non-expert users. A potential solution is translating natural questions into Sparql queries, known as Sparql generation. This paper addresses the challenges of translating natural language questions into Sparql queries for different knowledge graphs.

Methodology: 
We propose CoT-Sparql, our approach to generate Sparql queries from input questions. Our approach employs Chain-of-thoughts prompting that guides large language models through intermediate reasoning steps and facilitates generating precise Sparql queries. Furthermore, our approach incorporates entities and relations from the input question, and one-shot example in the prompt to provide additional context during the query generation process.

Findings: 
We conducted several experiments on benchmark datasets and showed that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Our approach achieves a significant improvement in F1 score of 4.4% and 3.0% for the QALD-10 and QALD-9 datasets, respectively.

Value: 
Our CoT-Sparql approach contributes to the semantic web community by simplifying access to knowledge graphs for non-expert users. In particular, CoT-Sparql enable non-expert end-users to query knowledge graphs in natural languages, where CoT-Sparql converts user natural languages queries into Sparql queries, which can be executed via the knowledge graph’s Sparql endpoint.""" ;

As legal documents endlessly evolve, companies are in favour of automatically processing these texts to facilitate the analysis and compliance. The automatic process involves first, in this pipeline, the extraction of legal entities. However, state-of-the-art approaches, like rule-based, Bi-LSTM or BERT for legal entity extraction have so far required a sufficient amount of data to be effective. Creating these training dataset however is a time-consuming task requiring input from domain experts. In this paper, we bootstrap the legal entity extraction by levering Large Language Models and a semantic model in order to reduce the involvement of the domain experts. We develop the industrial perspective by detailing the technical implementation choices. Consequently, we present our roadmap for an end-to-end pipeline designed expressly for the extraction of legal rules while limiting the involvement of experts." ;

For a foundational ontology, authors focused on structuring knowledge related to a deepfake attack, like the vulnerable entity, deepfake creator, attack goal, medium, generation technique, consequences, preventive measures, etc. The authors implemented knowledge graphs to evaluate ontology’s effectiveness in helping understand and infer deepfake event data.

Methodology: The authors used knowledge engineering methodology with 7 steps, including ontology scope determination, existing ontologies evaluation, and classes, properties, and relations definitions. The authors utilized Protégé Desktop and the W3C Web Ontology Development Language for ontology creation, the WIDOCO tool for ontology documentation, and OOPS for ontology validation. The authors developed a small-size deepfake events knowledge base to implement knowledge graphs, where the developed ontology defined the nodes and relations. GraphDB, a graph database, was used for knowledge graph implementation.

Findings: The manual literature review from prominent research publications, like IOS Press, IEEE Proceedings, CEUR-WS, etc., and evaluation of existing ontologies like DBpedia, MLOnto, and SEiCS helped identify 19 core entities and 28 relations describing the deepfake domain. The authors created SWRL rules that helped infer additional information from the deepfake attack knowledgebase via knowledge graphs application, such as various ways a particular entity can be affected by a deepfake, mediums used for attacks, and online security measures victims can adopt.

Value: Advanced AI-based Deepfakes are a threat to social, political, and economic structure via cases of defamation, political influence, financial fraud, harassment, etc. The developed ontology could be used to promote domain understanding and as a framework to build cybersecurity systems with better knowledge inference (semantic reasoning). The ontology can be extended iteratively with new domain advancements. As a next step, we plan on adopting NLP approaches for automating domain entity research and deepfake event knowledge base population.""" ;

Furthermore, we have studied the impact of each W (Who, Where, and When) on the performance of EvCBR on the Wikipedia Causal Event dataset. 

Methodology:  We proposed the XPEventCore ontology to represent 5W1H characteristics of events by integrating multiple event ontologies (SEM and FARO) and introduced new object properties for representing Cause and Method to answer “Why” and “How” questions. We adopted this XPEventCore ontology for a specific use case (the MR4AP Wikipedia dataset), and populated our EKG. Furthermore, we adapted EvCBR, a case-based reasoning approach, to enrich this EKG.

Findings: XPEventCore ontology provides a structured and adaptable foundation for capturing the essential facets of an event. It can be adapted to any domain (like MR4AP Wikipedia dataset) and populated to generate EKGs. Then, we applied the EvCBR, and subsequent analysis revealed that reasoning had a significant impact.

    schema:abstract """Purpose: Annotating is considered a 'scholarly primitive' among different fields in the humanities. Nevertheless, the debate on digital annotations has mostly focused on the annotation of textual data, whereas existing models for representing annotations of images still lack sufficient semantic richness to anchor the annotation itself to multiple conceptual levels. We address the challenge of defining a data model to overcome the problem of ‘semantic deficit’ in this application domain. Finally, we implement an annotation client for testing multi-level semantic annotations. 

Methodology: To define a data model for representing digital annotations, we analysed applications which support annotation images through IIIF protocol, focusing on digital representations of palimpsests. We then extended the Web Annotation Data Model by introducing domain standards such as LRMer, CIDOC-CRM, and HiCo. We also validated the model through SPARQL queries corresponding to five competency questions to report on satisfiability. Finally, we developed a prototype annotation client as a plugin for Mirador to evaluate its performances in real-world scenarios. 

Findings: The results indicate that our model can effectively disambiguate between a target image and multiple conceptual levels of the entity itself, proving to be decisive in the representation of entities that coexist in the same material item (e.g., palimpsests). Additionally, the model allows users to describe annotations as interpretative acts, incorporating scholarly criteria and multiple viewpoints. An interface plugin enables scholars without technical expertise to create structured annotations that comply with the model. 

Value: The proposed approach facilitates the detailed management of the relationships between digital resources and their annotations, improving interoperability and information accessibility in the Semantic Web domain. Future developments will concern further extensions of the model, considering information about versioning, provenance, and authoritativeness of the digital annotations on images, as well as support for meta-annotations and iconological levels of interpretation.""" ;

It addresses the challenges, such as the need for more standardization in data formats, metadata schemas, and inconsistent data quality, by developing a new ontology that supports the multifaceted analysis of medieval manuscripts. This analysis includes factors such as the historical context, physical characteristics, textual information, and artistic features.

Methodology: The MeLOn methodology is used to develop the Medieval Manuscript Data Integration Ontology (MMDIO), which extends the MeMO ontology. This process involves analyzing existing structures, identifying gaps, integrating elements from other ontologies, and creating new data classes and relationships. Protégé was used to design and validate schemas, GraphDB to test functionality and interoperability, Graffoo to visualize data, and LODE for publishing. Consequently, this comprehensive process significantly enhanced the data integration for the Mosaico and Irneiro systems.

Findings: The use of MMDIO substantially enhanced the organization, accessibility, and uniformity of metadata formats on both platforms. However, it can now handle complex queries and integrate multiple types of manuscript data to facilitate a more comprehensive and organized approach in medieval manuscript research.
