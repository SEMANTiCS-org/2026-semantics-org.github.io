    schema:abstract """Dell Technologies presents an industry use case focused on enhancing energy efficiency in manufacturing through advanced data analytics and semantic technologies, as part of the Horizon Europe funded GLACIATION project. Situated at the Cork (Ireland) Campus Manufacturing facility, this initiative analyzes data generated by Collaborative Robots (Cobots) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (Tugbots), integrating their operational and diagnostic data via the GLACIATION platform. The platform leverages a distributed knowledge graph, swarm intelligence for distributed search, and semantic web technologies as a metadata fabric to optimize the use of renewable energy sources, minimize energy consumption, and improve operational efficiencies. This innovative approach addresses the fragmented analysis of data from various robots, which previously hindered the facility's ability to optimize energy consumption and leverage advanced analytics.

By implementing the GLACIATION platform, Dell Technologies has created a data management and retrieval system, enhancing data accessibility and operational efficiency. The use of edge computing reduces latency, enabling real-time decision-making, while machine learning techniques extract valuable insights, facilitating predictive analytics and optimization of energy usage. The semantic reasoning capabilities further support data-to-knowledge transformation, ensuring effective resource management and operational efficiencies.

This use case showcases the practical application of these advanced technologies but also demonstrates significant benefits such as enhanced data retrieval efficiency, reduced operational costs, improved decision-making, and sustainability through effective utilization of renewable energy sources. Our presentation will detail the initial challenges, the innovative approach undertaken, the tangible benefits realized, and future prospects, providing a comprehensive view of the impact of semantic technologies in a real-world manufacturing setting.""" ;

    schema:abstract """One of the major challenges for growing crops in a greenhouse is determining which control strategy to use. Various digital twins exist that independently can simulate the effects of indoor climate- and crop-strategies on costs in terms of energy and resource usage and on benefits in terms of production and yield. Specifically, there are tools that can be used to generate growing strategies, tools to simulate greenhouse climate strategies and tools to calculate plant development. 
 
In the Dutch CODIT (Coupling Digital Twins) project, we combine and couple these digital twins in a semantically unambiguous manner using the Common Greenhouse Ontology (CGO), the standard for greenhouse data sharing. The value for greenhouse growers and advisors lies in better predictions on required climate, energy consumption, and production by combining the digital twins and enabling new business models. Our semantic solution makes it possible to exchange information with a commonly agreed meaning and format. In addition, our approach enables easy integration of other digital twins to be coupled and connected in the future, driving innovation. 
 
The CODIT solution is currently being used in a demonstration greenhouse with tomato plants during the growing season from October 2023 until October 2024. It generates weekly multiple greenhouse climate strategies and projects the resulting production and energy costs over the entire period. The crop manager can select the best strategy and receives the settings for the climate computer. Based on the feedback from the crop manager in our demonstration greenhouse, the CODIT software is being further finetuned. The proposed CODIT strategies are being compared with the actual plant development and energy consumption in the greenhouse. 
 
In this presentation, we will discuss the lessons learned in this use case when using a common ontology for coupling digital twins.""" ;

    schema:abstract """Initial situation
Large organizations must create a large quantity of information products. For example, the ministry of Finance must create a budget for government spending; a pension fund must create overviews of how much pension their customers have accrued; and municipalities must create building permits for project developers who want to construct new housing. Currently, most of the logic for constructing such information products is hidden in programming code that is difficult to understand, verify, and maintain.

Approach
We are able to create information products with linked data business rules, by utilizing the computational capabilities of SHACL Advanced Features. By doing so, we are able to express not only the data, but also computation over the data, as traceable and verifiable linked data. The resulting information products are represented in open standards like HTML, CSS, and SVG, that are compatible with the linked data standards.

Business value
The benefit of using linked data business rules for creating information products, is that the individual calculation rules are small and self-contained, while the complex execution of large rule collections is left to a standards-compliant SHACL engine. This allows organizations to create new information products, and maintain existing ones, with less maintenance overhead.

Prospects and recommendation
Our current ecosystem for creating information products with linked data includes vocabularies for HTML, DOM, XML, XPath, SVG, Mermaid, Manchester Syntax, and ReSpec. Our current applications are in generating budget tables, documentation, and formal reports in government administration services. We believe that this ecosystem will grow over time, and that an increasing number of information products will be created with this approach in the future.

    schema:abstract """In recent years, Flanders has been investing heavily in the openness of government. 
Until 2019, decisions of the Flemish government were published in purely human-interpretable form, on a Drupal website coupled to their document management system. However, the lack of semantics made it challenging for applications to consume this data.

For this purpose, redpencil has developed the Themis open data portal (https://themis.vlaanderen.be/), where information regarding the decision-making process of the Flemish Government is disseminated in the form of Linked Open Data. More specifically, every non-confidential decision that is made during the weekly council of ministers in Flanders is automatically exported from the government's platform and published to Themis in the form of RDF. To maximize interoperability, the data is structured according to the OSLO data model, an ontology created specifically for this purpose with the cooperation of all parties involved with the decision-making process.

While the intention of Themis is to stimulate reuse in semantic applications, the data is accessible for a wide range of consumers. The main consumer of this data today is the governments own press release website which provides human-readable information about the decisions made by the government.

There are two main ways to access the data (other than through the browser). On the one hand, it can be ingested through DCAT data catalogs, which is useful for applications that want all the data, all at once, for example to analyze it in bulk. On the other hand, the data can be queried using SPARQL, which is useful for applications that are interested in specific data, about specific decisions or topics. I will briefly introduce the technicalities behind both methods, and provide real-world examples of where this approach is used. To conclude, I will showcase a number of useful scenarios and third-party integrations that exist today. """ ;

    schema:abstract """Digital technologies as solutions within the agricultural sector are rising, but introducing the most suitable Digital Agricultural Technologies (DATs) to farmers remains difficult. Within the QuantiFarm project, we aim to match farmers with DATs from different sources and provide them with insights into the DATs. For this, we have developed the QuantiFarm Semantic Model (QCSM), an ontology including relevant agricultural concepts that allows for data standardization. We ingest data from three different sources into the QCSM based knowledge graph, hosted in a triple store according to the RDF standard. We then deploy a recommender tool to match farmers with relevant DATs. Through a personalized interface, a user of the QuantiFarm Search & Recommender Tool can search, filter and receive recommendations which are relevant to their Farmer Profile. The recommendations are based on mappings between the farmers’ and the DATs’ attributes in the QCSM knowledge graph. 

The benefits of the semantic approach include the transparency and interpretability of the reasoning behind the recommendations, as well as the harmonization of data from multiple sources. However, dealing with outlying and contradicting data remains a challenge, as well as ensuring correctness and stability of both the triple store and search & recommender tool. Future steps include improving on the matching methods, by using alternative knowledge graph based recommender methods such as path based linking, which will require the necessary updates to the QCSM. We can provide a demonstration during the SEMANTiCS conference, as the current version of the Search & Recommender Tool is available online as part of the QuantiFarm toolkit (https://quantifarmtoolkit.eu/).""" ;

    schema:abstract """Initial situation
Many companies who adopt linked data technologies for the first time, struggle with the creation of ontologies. Most data architects are used to modeling paradigms like UML, and in applications like Enterprise Architect or PlantUML. As a result, linked data projects often experience stagnation at the start, because there is too little experience with ontology development, and creating an ontology from scratch takes a lot of time.

Approach
We introduce a new approach, where existing data models are automatically transformed into ontologies. We build on existing SPARQL-based approaches that transform UML models (in XML or via an ODBC connection) to the Meta Information Model (MIM) standard. Subsequently, MIM can be transformed into OWL+SHACL. Existing approaches require that the source UML model is specifically annotated for use with the MIM standard, but data architects in companies often do not want to add such annotations. We therefore also automate the addition of MIM annotations. This results in a completely automated pipeline from UML tools like Enterprise Architect to an OWL+SHACL model.

Business value and benefits
By being able to generate the ontology from an existing data model in a fully automated way, companies can get their linked data projects underway much quicker. This allows companies to focus on other aspect, like value creation and data quality earlier in the project, which results in a better ROI from the project.

Prospects and recommendation
We believe that the best tool for modeling OWL+SHACL is sometimes a widely adopted UML tool. This is specifically the case when there is a lack of experience with semantic modeling. We think that our approach will be used in a growing number of commercial project, and will allow linked data projects to be more successful.""" ;

Since 2023, Capgemini has been assisting the Swedish Government in addressing fraudulent payments through the implementation of Knowledge Graph technology. This project employs a Labelled Property Graph approach using Neo4j as the graph database. 
Graph analytics, empowered by Graph Data Science, excels in fraud detection by identifying and exposing connections within fraudulent networks, providing investigators with crucial insights into their operations. Despite fraudsters efforts to conceal their identities and locations, graph analytics can detect fraudulent activities effectively. Its intuitive visual representation and ability to reveal hidden relationships make It a superior tool for uncovering and understanding the complexities of fraud.

When used for fraud detection, a graph data model links individuals, transactions and organizations to uncover patterns and indicators of fraud by comparing the connections with known fraud patterns in order to find similarities or anomalies in the data. 
In the end saving the Swedish taxpayers money and preventing fraudulent behavior.""" ;

In such a scenario, we face the challenges of word sense disambiguation (WSD), multiword expressions (MWE), and multilinguality (of models and content).

- For WSD and MWE, we need to exploit additional contextual knowledge to differentiate the word senses and identify expressions in the content.
- For multilinguality, we aim to support content that comes in a mix of languages, as well as querying across languages with an input query having a different language than the matching content.

To support both goals, we propose a combination of knowledge models, multilingual linguistic data (including lexicographic resources) and large (or massively multilingual) language models (LLMs). Via dictionary crossovers and other lexical information on multiple languages, we implement cross-language queries, and with the integration of LLMs we use these quality language resources to drive the disambiguation for the semantic annotations, thereby implementing a hybrid LLM-augmented Semantic AI system.

    schema:abstract """In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the integration of Knowledge Graphs and Neuro-symbolic AI presents a leap forward in enhancing threat detection and response capabilities. This presentation explores the synergistic combination of these technologies, particularly within the framework of Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) and Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII).

Knowledge Graphs, which represent data in a structured, interconnected format, offer a powerful means to capture the complex relationships inherent in cyber threat intelligence (CTI). By leveraging Knowledge Graphs, organizations can create a comprehensive and dynamic representation of cyber threats, enabling more effective correlation and contextualization of disparate data points. This holistic view is crucial for identifying sophisticated attack patterns that may be missed by traditional, isolated analysis methods.

Neuro-symbolic AI, which combines the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning, further enhances the capabilities of Knowledge Graphs. Neural networks excel at detecting patterns in large datasets, while symbolic reasoning provides a mechanism for understanding and manipulating complex concepts and relationships. This combination allows for more robust and accurate threat detection, as it can leverage both data-driven insights and human-understandable rules.

STIX(1)1, as a standardized language and serialization format for CTI, plays a pivotal role in this ecosystem. It enables organizations to share threat information in a consistent, machine-readable manner, facilitating collaborative threat analysis and automated detection and response. The integration of STIX with Knowledge Graphs and Neuro-symbolic AI enhances the ability to process and interpret CTI, leading to faster and more effective responses to cyber threats.

TAXII(1), the protocol designed for exchanging CTI over HTTPS, complements STIX by providing a scalable and standardized method for information sharing. By defining an API that aligns with common sharing models, TAXII ensures that the exchanged CTI can be seamlessly integrated into existing security workflows and systems. This interoperability is crucial for fostering a collaborative defense against cyber threats.

This presentation will delve into the practical applications of Knowledge Graphs and Neuro-symbolic AI in cybersecurity, highlighting their potential to transform threat detection and response. In particular we will be focusing on how to automatically extract structured STIX objects from unstructured incident reports. By incorporating the principles of STIX and TAXII, we demonstrate how these technologies can enhance collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, and ultimately, the overall security posture of organizations.

    schema:abstract """Data Spaces have become a big movement in Europe and beyond. The idea of trusted and secure data sharing between organisations - by keeping full data sovereignty - supports the approach of establishing the European digital single market and the development of new business models and it fosters value generation by making more use of the available data. With more and more Data Spaces and data available, the question of semantic interoperability becomes crucial and needs action. So how can we ensure that inside a Data Space AND between different Data Spaces relevant data can (i) be easily identified and then (ii) be easily and cost-efficiently used and integrated. 

To solve this we suggest a “Semantic Layer for Data Spaces”: an ecosystem of trusted, referenceable and interlinked controlled vocabularies accompanied with a set of related services, that allow to: (i) analyse metadata and also data (as far as available/accessible) inside of a Data Space and afterwards (ii) semantically annotates such datasets, thereby enriching the metadata and data. In addition, the Semantic Layer services are of value to (iii) support automated metadata mapping during metadata ingestion, and (iv) provide a service for semantic harmonisation of data. Together, these envisioned services form an implementation for augmented data catalogs which supports automated and intelligent metadata management and semantic interoperability based on Semantic AI.

The Semantic Layer for Data Spaces can be established as (i) a centralised service for Data Spaces that follow current standards or (ii) as federated service per Data Space to enable more flexibility, whereby we recommend the centralised approach. The implementation approach for this Semantic Layer is aligned with and even expands the IDS Reference Architecture Model Vocabulary Hub component, and supports the re-use of existing domain specific controlled vocabularies. Thereby this approach supports the recommendations of the High Level Forum of European Standardisation on data interoperability (https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/58914). The authors will present this approach along real world examples from the 2 EU funded projects: DataBri-X (https://databri-x.eu/), Underpin (https://underpinproject.eu/) and the Austrian-German lighthouse project: https://www.champi40ns.eu/.""" ;

    schema:abstract """In today's complex world, creating comprehensive solutions from compatible products presents significant challenges across various sectors. From manufacturing to retail, the overwhelming number of possible component combinations increases exponentially with scale, complicating the decision-making process for customers seeking tailored solutions. This complexity often leads to slow and expensive outcomes when trying to automate the calculation of optimal combinations. 

 

Throughout this demo we’ll follow two real-world applications of knowledge graphs and semantic reasoning: finding a range of furniture and household items that complement one another following the work of a global furniture retailer; and designing custom electro-mechanical systems from thousands of parts in order to meet specific and complex high-level requirements for the world's largest manufacturer of factory automation equipment. Although this is where we will focus, we’ll also highlight parallel use cases in a variety of industries that could massively benefit from this technology. 

 

Traditional search algorithms currently in use tend to be based on crowd behaviour, and fail to efficiently navigate through data that lacks explicit concepts, resulting in poor recommendations and a frustrating user experience. For example, a customer looking for a furniture set on an online retail site might struggle to find options that meet all their criteria like size, colour, style, material, and budget, along with practical considerations such as ease of cleaning for homes with pets or being safe for children. 

 

The solution lies in semantic reasoning, otherwise known as rules-based Artificial Intelligence (AI). By adding expert knowledge to the system in the form of rules, this technology contextualises and analyzes the relationships between products, akin to human reasoning. This AI-driven approach scales expert knowledge, alleviating the burden of manually configuring every potential product combination, while also introducing a method to automatically update the product catalogue—incremental reasoning. Incremental reasoning ensures the knowledge base is always consistent and up to date with the latest changes, calculating new configurations as new products are added and removing old when the relevant products are discontinued.  

 

Our presentation will demonstrate how this innovative use of knowledge graphs and rules-based AI significantly enhances customer experiences and reduces operational costs, regardless of the industry. """ ;

    schema:abstract """Semantic technology use cases for medical and pharma applications involve some of the largest and most complex ontologies and knowledge graphs. In this presentation we will hear about the first intelligent assistant of its kind that relies on a hybrid AI (logical semantic reasoning and ML image recognition), fully integrated on-device in ultrasound platforms—showcasing the SUOG (Smart Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology) project1. 

 

The use of semantic technology in this project will be explored along with how performance and scalability was achieved on-device by using an in-memory knowledge graph and reasoning engine. Examples and parallels will be highlighted showing this technology’s relevance with other medical applications and the pharma industry. 

 

A demo of the technology will give a closer look at how reasoning works in the context of knowledge-based AI applications. The combination of both machine learning and rules-based AI (reasoning) creates an incredibly powerful solution that serves to improve accuracy and enrich data, enhancing the ability of machine learning, here image recognition, to produce instant clinical knowledge and decision support on a hand-held device. 

 

We make reference to the use of LLMs in a clinical setting, pros and cons, and how they could work alongside expert knowledge where lives may literally be at stake. 

 

Finally, practical tips on how and where to get started with reasoning will be shared. Audience members will come away able to take their first steps towards implementing this technology in their own applications with examples for inspiration that follow our clients, including a healthcare device manufacturer.

    schema:abstract "An insight into how the Tax Authorities of the Netherlands uses semantic knowledge models. Lawyers and IT professionals often do not speak the same language, but they must still understand each other well. Knowledge and meaning from legislation and regulations needs to be described in such a way that it can be used in implementation. Think about models of concepts, definitions, object types with properties, data and rules, all linked together. We developed a method to make models and we publish our models in a model library (RDF, platform and tool independed). These models are used as input for the development of software. Our story is not about software. Software is about automation. Our story is about what precedes it." ;

    schema:abstract "We present an industry use case in which we discuss the practical use of a formal list of definitions. The list of definitions will be used as a basis for a knowledge graph that will serve knowledge panels when interacting with information in the company and that will help improve question answering using large language models. We evaluate whether the list is complete, whether the terms are relevant and whether there might be ambiguity in these terms. For this purpose we have analyzed a large body of company documents that represent how employees use these terms in practice, as well as a body of formal documents that represent how these terms are used in the industry in general. This has lead to the finding that some of the terms may not be ambiguous, but can be interpreted differently. There is a constant balance in a term list between completeness, level of abstraction and relevance. Determining which terms may lead to confusion because of multiple interpretations is a relevant step forward in creating usable knowledge graphs. " ;

    schema:abstract """The Dutch Water Organization Limburg (WL) has recognized the critical need to become more data-driven due to the increasing risks posed by climate change. The ability to make informed decisions based on high-quality, up-to-date information is essential. WL identified issues such as poor data quality, lack of asset status awareness, and underperforming IT resources during crises, which need to be addressed.
Our project, the 'Information Hub' or 'Informatieknooppunt' (IKP), integrates TopQuadrant's Enterprise Data Governance (EDG) and MongoDB within a Microsoft Azure infrastructure and Azure DevOps environment to form a comprehensive data fabric. This multimodal solution supports semantic knowledge graphs, which are vital for managing diverse data sources and providing a cohesive view of the operational landscape.
The IKP leverages information modeling and data governance based on the 'Metamodel voor Informatie Modellen' (MIM), enabling the organization to become 'information-aware'. By integrating enterprise architecture and business analytics with the IKP knowledge graph, the organization benefits from shared and newly acquired knowledge. The solution facilitates collaboration among business users, data scientists, and developers, enhancing the creation of information products like dashboards, analytics reports, and spatial awareness solutions.
Key benefits include the implementation of a hybrid data/DevOps methodology, availability of reference and master data as Linked Data, and the use of knowledge graphs to add value from legacy on-premise data sources. The semantic technology employed adheres to the FAIR principles, promoting a data-driven culture in line with the Common Ground vision for easy data exchange and access. Additionally, the IKP offers a pathway to understanding data governance and technical lineage across various data sources, providing a foundation for integrating Large Language Models and Generative AI.
Towards the production phase, new domains are continually incorporated, enriching the knowledge graphs' context and depth. It is essential to balance long-term goals with quick wins to demonstrate the solution's direction and generated value. Ultimately, adopting semantic technology and information modeling is crucial for driving cultural change towards data-awareness.""" ;

    schema:abstract "The evolution towards smart, semantic search capabilities is pivotal in search technologies. This talk delves into a modular, composable solution at this transformation's forefront. Traditional search systems often fall short of understanding the context and semantics of user queries, leading to suboptimal results. Our proposed modular RAG setup solution addresses these shortcomings by offering unparalleled flexibility and customization. “I want our website to be the place where users find answers on their questions and Smart Search is helping us do that”. We showcase the success of this setup by showing how we made this website better searchable, comparing it to the old website and its user experience. Organizations can seamlessly integrate various language models without altering the core architecture, such as OpenAI API, Azure OpenAI API, or open-source LLMs from Huggingface. The solution’s validation process employs benchmark datasets and user-specific data, ensuring the chosen configuration meets the desired search objectives. Deployable on any Kubernetes cluster, it guarantees data privacy and security, whether in a private or public cloud environment. The incorporation of knowledge graphs and content enrichment techniques grounds large language models and enrich search queries, particularly with non-textual, unstructured data. This talk advocates adopting such a semantic solution, highlighting its business value and benefits to the search domain." ;

    schema:abstract "The building design, construction, and operation sectors face sustainability challenges due to a fragmented manual processes, lack of integrated, automated solutions. There is a need for: 1) a scalable solution that complies with the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors to identify material risks and growth opportunities 2) a comprehensive solution that can effectively extract the semantic information from both structured and unstructured data and further integrate this knowledge across various data silos for downstream applications. However, this presents some challenges including but not limited to, ambiguous and interconnected domain concepts, necessity for domain- and customer-specific business knowledge, large volumes of (un)structured data, etc.. Our cloud-based semantic data modeling approach ai:cm can effectively address these challenges using advanced information retrieval techniques and semantic data modeling. The extracted knowledge is structured into a knowledge graph (RDF triples) and automatically linked to information sources like material databases. This could serve as the foundation for CO2 footprint calculations in industries such as construction, building design, and operations. The success of such an implementation can be measured by various KPIs, primarily the degree of automation, quality of attribute extraction, and accuracy of recommendations. The semantic aspect of our solution ai:cm offers reusability and interoperability of existing data models, like Industry Foundation Class (IFC), extensibility for new data inputs and requirements, validation and execution of business rules using SHACL shapes, and UI generation for ad-hoc updates.

    schema:abstract "The Teaming.AI project, funded through the European Commission's Horizon 2020 Research Programme under Grant Agreement Number 957402, intends to provide a human-AI teaming platform for maintaining and evolving AI systems in manufacturing. The project started back in Initiated in January 2021 and concluded in June 2024, a total of 15 research and industry partners from across Europe collaboratively developed a novel operational framework to cope with the heterogeneity of data types, the uncertainty of decisions, and the dynamic changes in the context of human-AI collaboration. A key component of the project is the Teaming.AI knowledge graph (KG), which acts as a digital shadow of human-AI collaboration scenarios. This KG has been deployed in three real-world manufacturing use-cases aimed at enhancing efficiency in plastic molding (Spain, Turkey) and improving the ergonomic health of workers in large part manufacturing (Spain). The concept behind the Teaming.AI KG introduces significant challenges such as the conceptualization of the application in an ontology and the dynamic changes in the context of human-AI collaborations, with updates occurring in seconds rather than hours. To counteract these challenges, the Teaming.AI KG is built upon a modular KG population approach based on automated KG transformations of process model executions. Specifically, task expertise is treated as sub-domains, facilitating the creation of domain-specific ontology definitions. Additionally, the KG entities that represent the executions of process elements, such as tasks, events, or transitions, can be easily enriched with task expertise. This enrichment enables an automated semantic linking between sub-domains through the process executions, enhancing the KG's functionality and responsiveness. This industry talk features an interactive demonstration that showcases the implementation of the dynamic KG generation and population approach within one of the real-world human-AI collaboration scenarios." ;

By publishing a Linked Data Event Stream (LDES) of an art collection, we enable everyone, whether you’re Europeana, an archive, or a thematic project such as “Against Opacity”,  to fully replicate the art collection and publish a derived version that is guaranteed to stay in sync with the source thereafter. In this talk, we present Interoperable Europe’s SEMIC pilot for the adoption of LDES with CIDOC-CRM at Rijksmuseum and how that enables us now to reuse existing generic RDF Connect tooling. That tooling was already employed in completely distinct pilots as well, such as address registries with the SEMIC Core Vocabularies, metadata harvesting with DCAT-AP, marine biology taxonomies from Maregraph, or the European railway infrastructure of ERA." ;
